### Mammoth Cave National Park
Here is another episode of our most recent visit to Mammoth NP. We planned a 3-day trip from Seattle to the national park. I am not going to give you an itinerary or enumerate a  list of top 5 things to do inside the park. You can open up Chat GPT and probably figure it our yourself.

Here is what I felt inside the park: 

Clear skies fall upon one as they enter the park. The luminiscence of the moon, or the mere stars is enough to enlighten the otherwise dormant senses. The circular ripples in the creek that walks beside the winding road invites the eyes to explore further. The more one follows the water, the more untamable the surrounding gets. The cold in the air and the stillness of sleeping bats calm the nerves.  At this instant, the wait becomes impatient. The itching for gettiing to the mammoth intensifies. The cave knows about this emotions. It invites one in the most amiable way possible. Darkness and silence.

The mammoth runs deep and long. The layers of rocks cut by flowing water have shaped it to a colorful amalgam of history and sciene.
