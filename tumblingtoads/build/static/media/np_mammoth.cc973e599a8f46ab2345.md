### Mammoth Cave National Park
Here is another episode of our most recent visit to Mammoth NP. We planned a 3-day trip to the national park. I am not going to give you an itinerary or enumerate a  list of the top 5 things to do inside the park. You can open up Chat GPT and probably figure it out yourself.


Here is what I felt inside the park:


Clear skies fall upon one as they enter the park. The luminescence of the moon, or the mere stars is enough to enlighten the otherwise dormant senses. The circular ripples in the creek that walks beside the winding road invite the eyes to explore further. The more one follows the water, the more untamable the surrounding gets. The cold in the air and the stillness of sleeping bats calm the nerves.  At this instant, the wait becomes impatient. The itching to get to the mammoth intensifies. The cave knows about these emotions. It invites one in the most amiable way possible. Darkness and Silence.

The mammoth runs deep and long. The layers of rocks wounded by the flowing water have exposed the nakedness within. Yet a wonder to watch. Colors, Shapes, History and Science. As one sets the first foot inside, a cold familiar breeze touches the tip of the skin and renders the virtual flashes of what lies ahead. The remnants of hanging bats, the scribblings of voyagers, the sparkling gypsum, and the marvellous tenacity of rocks are proof that nature ages well.
