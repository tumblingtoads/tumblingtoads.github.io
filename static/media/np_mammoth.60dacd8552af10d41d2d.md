### Mammoth Cave National Park
Here is another episode of our most recent visit to Mammoth NP. We planned a 3-day road trip from Seattle to the park.

You will know when you are among Redwoods. They will suddenly emerge from behind once you get past the Crescent City. They are so thick and long that even your imaginary T-Rex will feel tiny.

Once you get there, you can get started by visiting the Prairie Creek visitor center. First things first, get the NP passport stamped. Next, talk to a few rangers and get a map. A bunch of trails start right behind the visitor cater. I recommend taking the Karl Knapp trail and continuing to the West Ridge trail. This 8-mile loop is worth it. You will get to see some of the rare giant trees still alive on this planet. If you are still in awe then head to Redwood Access trail. This trail is pure beauty. You can spend the rest of the day on Golds Bluff Beach.

Next day, you need to be on Holland Hill Drive. This is an unpaved road where you get to drive among the giants. There are plenty of tails emerging from the road. I recommend doing Grove of Titans. This trail runs along Mill Creek and has a lot of ferns along its grove.

Optional: Go for the Trees of Mystery fun adventure. This park has tons of activities to offer ranging from beautiful gondola rides to tree trails.
